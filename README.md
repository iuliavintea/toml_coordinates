# toml_coordinates
By using bedtool the merged_genes.txt file was generated. In this step overlapping genes and genes that came closer than 20kb were merged. Also sense and antisense were indicated in an extra column in the dataframe. The final file is a vector with all the chromosome coordinates needed for the TOML file.
